# When making commits that are strictly formatting/style changes, add the
# commit hash here, so git blame can ignore the change. See docs for more
# details:
# https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/using-files/viewing-a-file#ignore-commits-in-the-blame-view
#
# Github will use this file to ignore these commits for blame.
#
# Run this to configure git locally to also ignore these commits:
#   git config blame.ignoreRevsFile .git-blame-ignore-revs

# Ran prettier on the entire codebase
